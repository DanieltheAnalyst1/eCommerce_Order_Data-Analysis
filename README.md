# SQL Project: eCommerce Order Data Analysis

## Overview
This project analyzes eCommerce order data to uncover critical insights into customer demand, ordering behavior, and peak periods. Using SQL, I processed and visualized data to support decisions around marketing, inventory management, and customer service.

## Key Insights
- **Total Orders**: Overall count of orders.
- **Orders by Location**: Distribution across states and cities.
- **Orders Over Time**: Monthly trends and daily ordering patterns.
- **Peak Order Days**: Busiest days for order processing.

**Goal**: Provide valuable insights to enhance marketing strategies, improve inventory management, and optimize customer satisfaction in an eCommerce environment.

## Who Needs This?
- **eCommerce Managers**: To better plan inventory and staff resources.
- **Marketing Teams**: To align promotions with peak ordering times and locations.
- **Supply Chain/Logistics Managers**: To optimize delivery routes based on geographic demand.

## My Role
As a **Data Analyst**, I developed SQL queries to explore patterns in the eCommerce order data, helping businesses make data-driven decisions that improve efficiency, target the right customers, and enhance profitability.

## SQL Code Highlights
### Total Orders
```sql
SELECT 
    COUNT(*) AS total_orders
FROM 
    list_of_orders;
```
- **Purpose**: Quickly understand overall order volume, providing insight into business activity and growth.

### Orders by Location (State and City)
```sql
SELECT 
    State,
    COUNT(*) AS total_orders
FROM 
    list_of_orders
GROUP BY 
    State
ORDER BY 
    total_orders DESC;
```
```sql
SELECT 
    City,
    COUNT(*) AS total_orders
FROM 
    list_of_orders
GROUP BY 
    City
ORDER BY 
    total_orders DESC;
```
- **Purpose**: Identify geographic areas driving the most sales. This helps businesses optimize delivery routes and focus marketing efforts on high-performing locations.

### Monthly Order Trends
```sql
SELECT 
    DATE_FORMAT(STR_TO_DATE(Order_Date, '%d-%m-%Y'), '%Y-%m') AS month,
    COUNT(*) AS total_orders
FROM 
    list_of_orders
GROUP BY 
    month
ORDER BY 
    month;
```
- **Purpose**: Highlight monthly order volume trends, which assist in planning inventory and marketing campaigns around busy seasons.

### Orders by Day of the Week
```sql
SELECT 
    DAYNAME(STR_TO_DATE(Order_Date, '%d-%m-%Y')) AS day_of_week,
    COUNT(*) AS total_orders
FROM 
    list_of_orders
GROUP BY 
    day_of_week
ORDER BY 
    FIELD(day_of_week, 'Sunday', 'Monday', 'Tuesday', 'Wednesday', 'Thursday', 'Friday', 'Saturday');
```
- **Purpose**: Understand customer buying behavior by day of the week, informing decisions around operational planning and promotional events.

### Peak Order Days
```sql
SELECT 
    Order_Date,
    COUNT(*) AS total_orders
FROM 
    list_of_orders
GROUP BY 
    Order_Date
ORDER BY 
    total_orders DESC
LIMIT 10;
```
- **Purpose**: Identify the top 10 busiest days, ensuring the business is prepared for these high-demand periods.

## Real-World Impact
By leveraging these insights, eCommerce businesses can:
- **Optimize inventory**: Ensure popular products are in stock during high-demand periods.
- **Target marketing campaigns**: Focus on peak order days and locations.
- **Improve customer satisfaction**: Reduce delays by anticipating and managing demand effectively.

## Why It Matters
In the fast-paced eCommerce world, understanding customer behavior is critical to staying ahead of the competition. This analysis helps businesses make informed decisions, driving both operational efficiency and revenue growth.

## Where I Add Value
As a **Data Analyst**, I transform complex datasets into actionable business insights. This project showcases how I help eCommerce companies optimize their operations, improve their customer experience, and drive higher profits by making data-driven decisions.
